Q&A - Hands in the Sea, 2nd Edition

== General Rules questions
Q: Does a 0-strength elepant contribute to cavalry superiority?
A: No. Cavalry superiority is based on combat strength points, not the number of cards.

Q: Do I have to play a card to move a fleet?
A: No, it only requires an action.

Q: What card, if any, must be played to start the naval combat? Or is the declaration sufficient in itself?
A: You must play a card with a ship symbol to initiate naval combat.

Q: Can I move the Roman fleet from Africa to my Home port?
A: Not in a single move. It would normally take 3 actions - first move the fleet to Corsica
   or Sicily, then Italy, and finally into the Roman Home port. The Seamanship strategy card
   could shorten this if you spend the silver.

   The only way you could move your Roman fleet directly to your Home port from Africa if
   its defeated in a naval battle, although such a retreat is neither a move, nor an action.

Q: Can a fleet harbor at any friendly coastal location?
A: No, any fleet not in its Home port is considered at sea. Note also the clarification on
   naval retreats below.

Q: Does a player win when he completes the requisite number of towns, cities, prestige points?
A: No, that's only a game ending condition. Both players should add up VP to determine the winner.

Q: Is an undefended town or city automatically captured if the owner does not have
   a fortification or defend it with a card?
A: No, all towns have an instrinsic defense strength that the attacker must overcome.

Q: Where do combat losses go?
A: Back to the empire deck, where they would have to be re-purchased.

Q: If you use a location card in battle, does it return to the discard pile if not lost in battle?
A: Location cards are never lost in battle. They always return to the discard pile after battle.

Q: Can a fleet harbor at say, Panormus, Caralis?
A: No. The only harbors are Rome for the Romans, and Carthage for the Carthaginians.

Q: Does a fort add + 1 or +2 to the defense?
A: A fort adds +2.

Q: Do I gain prestige for winning a battle against a neutral Syracuse?
A: No.

Q: Is it possible to lose prestige points?
A: No.

Q: What is the definition of a mercenary exactly?
A: Any card with the bribe symbol on it is considered a mercenary.

Q: Are we allowed to return "S" cards to the Empire deck?
A: Yes, except for the Rome and Carthage location cards.

Q: Can any town be developed into a city?
A: No, only those towns with a colonist symbol.

== Card Questions
Q: Is Roman Legion I already considered paid for? Or does the Roman player have to
   pay the cost when it's first played.
A: It's already considered paid for.

Q: Does Seamanship affect supply for purposes of VP collection?
A: No.

Q: Do Roman legions that were committed to a naval battle via Corvus from reserve return
   to the reserve upon victory, or go to the discard pile.
A: To the discard pile or empire deck, depending on the outcome.

== Clarifications, Updates and Suggested Changes from the Designer

* In the Engage Enemy Fleet rules (5.2.5) where the text currently says, "the loser
  of the naval battle must choose to either retreat his Fleet to an adjacent Sea Zone
  that contains a friendly port or send it to his Home Port.", change the words
  "friendly port" to "friendly coastal location".

=== Suggested Changes
* Add 1 town cube to each player. This should help a little bit with the
  Carthaginian Rush Strategy.
* Make the Pillage track linear, i.e. the opposing player loses 1, 2, 3 or 4 VP
  after the 2nd, 4th, 6th and 8th successful pillage, respectively. The 8th
  successful pillage should be added as a game ending condition.
