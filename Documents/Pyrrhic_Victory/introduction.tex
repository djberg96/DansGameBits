\section{Introduction}

Pyrrhic Victory is a 2-player variant for the GMT game \textit{Sword of Rome}. This variant covers the campaigns of Pyrrhus of Epirus in Italy and Sicily during 280-275 BC.

This game utilizes many of the components of the original game, including the map and counters. It does, however, use its own deck of cards and uses modified rules and victory conditions.
