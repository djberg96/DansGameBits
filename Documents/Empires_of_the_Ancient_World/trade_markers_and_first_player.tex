\section{Trade Markers and 1st Player Determination}

\subsection{Trade Markers}

Each player places five trade markers on their Warehouse card. Place an additional trade marker for every province you control that contains an Amphorae symbol, as well as one for each Merchant card on display.

Any markers left on the card from the last turn stay on the card and do not affect the number of markers placed. Each player has a limited supply of trade markers which represents a hard limit to the number of trade markers that may be placed in your Warehouse.

Certain actions require the expenditure of trade markers. Any expended trade markers are placed back in the player’s stock, which means they are again available for placement on the following turn.

\subsection{Determine First Player}

On the first turn the player with the highest sum of 3d6 is the 1st player (re-roll any ties). Note that this may be a different player from the player who placed the first control marker. In subsequent turns the 1st Player marker moves on to the next player, going clockwise.

The Round marker should be placed on the space matching the present turn. so on the first turn it starts on the “1” space, on the second turn it starts on the “2” space, etc.
