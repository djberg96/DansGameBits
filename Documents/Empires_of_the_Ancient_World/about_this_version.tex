\section{ABOUT THIS VERSION}

What started as an effort to simply port the rules into a PDF with a larger font that my poor eyes could handle turned into a bit of rules overhaul instead. I've made some changes in general sentence structure, verbiage, layout and capitalization.

I've also added a case system so that it's easier to reference things.

There are no rules changes, except that I've added any updates or clarifications from Martin Wallace that I could find online.

Notably, I've occasionally changed "the player" (when referring to the active player) with simply "you".

This presentation of the rules were created using LaTeX (TeXstudio). They are freely available on github.

I may also add some graphics at some point.
