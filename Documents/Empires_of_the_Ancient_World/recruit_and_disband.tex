\subsection{Recruit and Disband}

\subsubsection{RECRUIT}

You may take one of the six face-up cards on display. You have the option of first discarding all six cards on display and drawing six new cards by expending one trade marker from your Warehouse. This option may only be taken once during the current action round.

Once you have taken a card, draw a new card to replace it so that there are always six cards on display. If the deck is exhausted, then reshuffle the deck first before drawing.

There is no limit to the number of cards that a player may hold.

The following cards must be placed on display in front of a player if selected: Military Leader, Engineer, Merchant, and Diplomat. A player may only have one Military Leader, Engineer or Diplomat on display, but may have any number of Merchants.

You may only take a card marked “North” if you control at least one area in the north, and may only take a card marked “South” if you control at least one area in the south. You never lose a card if you take one of these cards and later lose all of your provinces in the north or south.

\subsubsection{DISBAND}

Instead of taking a card, you may choose to discard a card (disband). You cannot discard a card that is on display, i.e. you cannot discard a Military Leader, Engineer, Merchant or Diplomat.
