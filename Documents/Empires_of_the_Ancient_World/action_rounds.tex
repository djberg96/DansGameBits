\section{ACTION ROUNDS}

The Action Round phase is the meat of the game. In player order, going clockwise from the first player, each player will select one action. Once each player has completed an action the Round marker is increased one space and players carry out another action. The phase ends when the Round marker cannot be advanced any further.

A player can choose from the following actions:

\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
  \item Attack a province
  \item Recruit an available army card
  \item Fortify
  \item Place trade markers
  \item Place a control marker
\end{enumerate}
