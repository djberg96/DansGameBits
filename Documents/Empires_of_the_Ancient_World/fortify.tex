\section{Fortify}

As an action, you may place a Fortification marker (black disk) in a province you control by expending four trade markers from your Warehouse. If you have an Engineer card on display then the cost is only two trade markers.

There can only be one Fortification marker in a province. Sea areas cannot be fortified.

The presence of a Fort in an area allows the defender to resolve a battle there using Siege Combat instead of fighting in the open. See the rules on Siege Combat for details.

Forts have no effect on Diplomatic attacks. Forts change owners if a Diplomatic attack succeeds against an area with a Fort.
