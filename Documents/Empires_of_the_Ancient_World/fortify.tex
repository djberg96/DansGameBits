\section{Fortify}

As an action, you may place a Fortification marker (black disk) in a province you control by expending four trade markers from your Warehouse. If you have an Engineer card on display then the cost is only two trade markers.

There can only be one Fortification marker in a province. Sea areas cannot be fortified.
