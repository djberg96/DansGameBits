\section{Revolt Phase}

There are two Revolt Tables printed on the board. Roll one die to determine which of the two tables to use. Then roll a second die to determine which column on the table applies. This column will list a number of provinces which are subject to revolt. If a province revolts then one control marker must be removed from it. This will cause it to become neutral if there are no control markers remaining.

If a player still has one or more control markers in the province after removing one from a revolt, then that player retains control of the province.

No control markers are removed from a province which contains a fortification.
