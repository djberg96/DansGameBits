\section{Trade Markers}

As an action, you may place up to two trade markers from your Warehouse onto the map. The markers can be placed in or adjacent to any province or sea area that already contains one of your control markers.

The markers do not have to be placed in the same province or sea area. The markers are placed one at a time, and the placement of the first marker allows the second one to be played adjacent to it, i.e. you can "chain" the trade markers.

The total number of markers allowed in a province or sea area is equal to the victory point value of the province/area. For every Merchant card on display, you may place an extra marker from their Warehouse.

You can attempt to displace another player’s trade marker if the province or sea area is full. Roll a die. On a 5 or higheryou  may remove another player’s marker and replace it with your own. For every Merchant card on display you gain +1 to the die roll. If the attempt fails then the trade marker is placed back into your stock.
