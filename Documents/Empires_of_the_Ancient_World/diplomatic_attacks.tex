\subsection{Diplomatic Attacks}

You do not have to use an army to attack a province. Instead, you can use diplomacy to attempt to take control of an adjacent neutral province or sea area.

A diplomacy attempt requires the expenditure of two trade markers from your Warehouse, then roll a die. On a 2 or higher you takes control of the province or sea area. You do not need to roll for sea movement, mountains or straits.

If you have a Diplomat card on display then the cost is only one trade marker (instead of two) and the attempt is automatically successful.

You may also attempt to remove another playerâ€™s control marker from an adjacent province or sea area. Roll a die. On a 6 or higher remove one control marker from the targeted area. You gain +1 to the die roll for every trade marker, up to a maximum of three trade markers. If the area becomes neutral then place one of your own control markers in the region and take control of it.

No plunder is gained from diplomatic attacks.
