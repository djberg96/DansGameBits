\section{GAME OVERVIEW}

Empires of the Ancient World is set in the Mediterranean world between 200 B.C. and 200 A.D. Each playerâ€™s goal is to conquer as much of the known world as possible, not just militarily but also through trade.

The heart of the game is the card system. Players decide the tactics of their armies by recruiting cards. Each type of card has a strength and a weakness. For example, Pike units will beat Cavalry but will suffer at the hands of sword wielding Infantry. Skirmishers can be used to attempt to screen units but must be wary of being hit by Cavalry. Players can also engage Merchants to increase their trading capacity, use Engineers to build Fortifications, and Diplomats to influence neutral provinces.

The game is for 3 to 5 players and should take between 2 and 3 hours to complete.
