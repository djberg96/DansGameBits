\section{CLIENT FORCES}

Client forces represent independent or semi-independent force which came under the control of the two major powers. Client forces include Armenians, Arabs and Alani. The following rules apply only to the Basic Game.

\subsection{Armenians}

The Parthian player controls all Armenian units if they are in a scenario.

\subsection{Arabs and Alani}

Do not use the Arab or Alani units in the basic game.

\subsection{Client Reinforcements\\*and Replacements}

There are no Client reinforcements or replacements in the basic game. Once eliminated, such units are out of play permanently.

Note that certain scenarios start with client units eliminated and hence permanently out of play.
