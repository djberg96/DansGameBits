\section{POLITICAL EVENTS}

During the Political Events Segment, one player rolls two dice and checks the Political Events Table. This will lead to a Political Event, which is then applied.

Roll two dice, treat the first number as the "tens" digit, the second number as "ones," and compare this with the Political Events table, immediately applying the result. For example, a roll of "1" and "2" would be "12," Pro Parthian Omens.

The players should alternate rolling on the Political events Table, with the Romans rolling on the first turn of the game; note that regardless of who rolls on the table, the results may apply to either or both players.

Unless otherwise specified, an Event may occur more than once per game.
