\subsection{THE GAME MAP}

The 22"x32" mapsheet portrays the area in which the battle was fought. It includes all the significant terrain in the battle. It also displays the Terrain Key and the Turn Record Track.

A hexagonal grid is superimposed over the terrain features printed on the mapsheet in order to regularize movement and positioning of the playing pieces.

To make the map lie flat, back-fold it against the creases. Small pieces of masking tape may be used at the corners of the map to hold it taut.

\subsection{GAME CHARTS AND TABLES}

Various visual aids are provided for the Players in order to simplify and illustrate certain game functions. These are the Terrain Effects Chart, the Combat Results Table, the Reinforcement Chart and the Turn Record Track.

\subsection{THE PLAYING PIECES}

The cardboard pieces represent the actual military units that took part in the original battle. The numbers and symbols on the pieces represent the strength, movement capability and type of unit represented by that piece. These playing pieces will hereafter be referred to as "units".
