\subsection{COMMENTS ON THIS VERSION}

This version is based on the S\&T Magazine version of the rules. Nearly all of the text was kept in tact as-is, with the occasional typo fix and some slight formatting differences. However, I've also integrated clarifications and errata that I could find online, as well as the AH rules regarding rail cuts. These have been marked in blue text.

As for presentation, I switched from a three-column layout to a two-column layout, and also used a larger font, since I am not constrained by the magazine format and do not need to worry about page count.

I also used my own custom images for the game equipment section. These were originally created using SVG, converted into hi-res PNG files using Inkscape, then scaled down so they fit into the page properly.

This text was created using LaTeX, mainly on a Mac using TeXstudio, then converted into a PDF document.
