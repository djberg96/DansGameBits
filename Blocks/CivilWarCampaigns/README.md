# Description

The images here are prototypes for a theoretical re-imagining of the Civil
War Campaign Series from Clash of Arms Games.

# Units

Instead of using hidden counters and a separate tracking sheet, this variant uses blocks to track strength and losses. Units with more than four strength have breakdown blocks.

The off-color pips represent that the unit is currently "ineffective".
