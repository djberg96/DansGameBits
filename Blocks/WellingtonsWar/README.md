# Naming Convention

Each file is given a unique name, typically by including a unit's designation (if any) and nationality (if appropriate). This is mostly done for the sake of Vassal, which requires unique filenames.

# Vassal and Batik

The Vassal application currently uses the Batik SVG rendering engine. While this mostly works, there are a few properties that it does not support. Namely, it does not support `dominant-baseline` or `alignment-baseline`. This effectively means that vertical alignment will have to be done manually via y-coordinates.
