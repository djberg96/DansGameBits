## Force Pools

Both the French player and Anglo-Allied player have their own force pools, with
the Anglo-Allied player's units divided between the Spanish and British/Portuguese
Force Pools. The Force Pool areas on the map are mostly just a place to put units.
The actual "pool" (i.e. the place where you'll draw reinforcement blocks from) is the
spot right above the flag for each nation. You will see the outline when it's empty.

When you drag a unit here it will automatically turn face down. If you draw from
this pool it will give you a random block, hidden by default.

## Scenarios

There are two scenarios to choose from when you start the module, either the
full Campaign Game or the shorter 1812 scenario. The Campaign Game is setup and
ready to go, while the 1812 scenario includes some additional setup markers and
has additional setup instructions you'll need to go through before you can start.
See below for more details.

### 1812 Scenario

For the Spanish setup I have put the four initial setup blocks in the force pool.
Draw them one at a time and place them in the start areas which have been marked.
Once that is complete, put the Spanish blocks that started face up into the Force
Pool area into the actual force pool (i.e. on the Spanish flag).

The French player has two initial setup groups. The first group starts in the
force pool. Once those units have been placed, drag the units from the second
initial group into the pool. Drag them out and set them one at a time as per the
scenario setup instructions. Once both initial setup groups have been placed, put
the remaining French blocks that started face up in the Force Pool area into the
actual force pool (i.e. on the French flag).

Some forces have variable setup. I have added a label to these units as a
reminder. Simply remove the label once you've placed the unit.

## Fortress Markers

There are fortress markers, but it is difficult to mark units inside from those
outside since they markers are on their own layer. I recommend using labels as
an additional mnemonic for which units are inside a fortress.

## Area Control Markers

There are twenty total areas on the map, each with their own control marker. The
control markers can be in one of three possible states - French controlled, Allied
controlled, or contested. Simply "flip" the marker until it reaches the desired
position. I have deliberately offset these markers so that the forage values for
the area are not covered up. You should not move or delete these markers, though
you can recreate them if an accident happens.

## Victory Points

At this time the VP tracking must be done manually, i.e. you will have to calculate
the totals at the end of each turn and mark the VP accordingly. In a future update
I plan to automate this process.
