## Force Pools

Both the French player and Anglo-Allied player have their own force pools, with
the Anglo-Allied player's units divided between the Spanish and British/Portuguese
Force Pools. The Force Pool areas on the map are mostly just a place to put units.
The actual "pool" (i.e. the place where you'll draw reinforcement blocks from) is the
spot right above the flag for each nation. You will see the outline when it's empty.

When you drag a unit here it will automatically turn face down. If you draw from
this pool it will give you a random block, hidden by default.

## Event and Command Card Decks

Although there are spaces on the map for them, both the Event and Command decks
have separate, dedicated windows where they are managed. It was just easier this way,
and didn't require tricks with rotating the Command cards. I might change this
in the future, but for now just use the dedicated windows.

The deck spaces on the board now show the total number of cards remaining
in their respective decks.

## Scenarios

At this time there is one scenario to choose from when you start the module, the
full Campaign Game. The Campaign Game is mostly setup and ready to go. The only thing
you need to do is drag the appropriate face-up units in the Force Pool that are stacked
next to the pool area into the actual pool. This is the area around the flag, you will
see the black outline.

I left these face up at the start so that both players who are not familiar with the
scenario setup could see what each side has.

The reinforcements have been organized into their own stacks based on the turn that
they arrive and are also in the Force Pool area. Units that only arrive via events
have not been placed in the force pool area. You will have to grab them out of the
pieces palette as needed.

## Fortress Markers

There are fortress markers, but it is difficult to mark units inside from those
outside since the markers are on their own layer. I recommend using labels as
an additional mnemonic for which units are inside a fortress.

## Area Control Markers

There are twenty total areas on the map, each with their own control marker. The
control markers can be in one of three possible states - French controlled, Allied
controlled, or contested. Simply "flip" the marker until it reaches the desired
position. I have deliberately offset these markers so that the forage values for
the area are not covered up. You should not move or delete these markers, though
you can recreate them if an accident happens.

## Force Levels

Force levels for each faction are now tracked automatically via a text label near
the faction's home area. Note that the force level track marker is not automatically
moved, but you are free to manually move it as needed.

## Region Highlighting

If you click on the name of a region on the main map it will highlight the area to
show you exactly where the borders are. Simply click it again to remove the highlighting.

## Victory Points

At this time the VP tracking must be done manually, i.e. you will have to calculate
the totals at the end of each turn and mark the VP accordingly.

## Future Plans

* Automate the VP counting process via a button click.
* Possibly different rotation mechanism for the blocks so that only the pips rotate.
* Show the Pool and Hand counts.
* Add the 1812 scenario.
